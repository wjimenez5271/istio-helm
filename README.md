# istio-helm
Helm chart for Istio

This is the helm repository branch. You can add this repository to your local helm client by running:

`helm repo add wjimenez5271 https://wjimenez5271.github.io/istio-helm/`

This repo contains a helm chart for quickly standing up the
microservices framework [Istio](https://istio.io/). It was tested on
[Rancher](http://rancher.com) 1.6 but should work on any 1.6 version of Kubernetes.
